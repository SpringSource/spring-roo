Thanks for contributing Spring Roo.

These instructions are aimed at experienced developers looking to *develop Spring Roo itself*. If you are new to Spring Roo or would simply like to try a release that has already been built, tested and distributed by the core development team, we recommend that you visit the https://projects.spring.io/spring-roo/[Spring Roo Home Page] and download an official release.

== Code of Conduct

This project adheres to the Contributor Covenant link:CODE_OF_CONDUCT.adoc[code of conduct]. By participating, you  are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to spring-code-of-conduct@pivotal.io.

== Before Contributing

=== Search StackOverflow first; discuss if necessary

For general usage questions please ask on https://stackoverflow.com/[stackoverflow], tagged with https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/spring-roo[spring-roo].

=== Search JIRA; create an issue if necessary

Is there already an issue that addresses your concern? Do a bit of searching in the https://jira.spring.io/browse/ROO[Spring ROO] issue tracker to see if you can find something similar. If you do not find something similar, please create a new JIRA issue before submitting a pull request unless the change is truly trivial.

=== Sign the Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

If you have not previously done so, please sign the https://cla.pivotal.io/sign/spring[Contributor License Agreement].

[[gpg-pgp-setup]]
== GPG (PGP) Setup

Roo uses GPG to automatically sign build outputs. If you haven't installed GPG, download and install it:

* Main site: https://www.gnupg.org/download/
* Apple Mac option: https://macgpg.sourceforge.io/

Ensure you have a valid signature. Use _"gpg --list-secret-keys"_. 

You should see some output like this:

[source,bash]
----
$ gpg --list-secret-keys
/home/balex/.gnupg/secring.gpg
sec   1024D/00B5050F 2009-03-28
uid                  Ben Alex <ben.alex@acegi.com.au>
uid                  Ben Alex <ben.alex@springsource.com>
uid                  Ben Alex <balex@vmware.com>
ssb   4096g/2DB6833B 2009-03-28
----

If you don't see the output, it means you first need to create a key. 

It's very easy to do this, just use _"gpg --gen-key"_.

Then verify your newly-created key was indeed created: _"gpg --list-secret-keys"_.

Next you need to publish your key to a *public keyserver*. Take a note of the "sec" key ID shown from the _--list-secret-keys_. In my case it's key ID _"00B5050F"_. 

Push your public key to a keyserver via the command _"gpg --keyserver hkp://pgp.mit.edu --send-keys 00B5050F"_ (_of course changing the key ID at the end_). Most public key servers share keys, so you don't need to send your public key to multiple key servers.

Finally, every time you build you will be prompted for the password of your
key.

You have *several options*:

* Type the password in every time
* Include a _-Dgpg.passphrase=thephrase_ argument when calling "mvn"
+
[source,bash]
----
$ ./mvnw clean install -Dgpg.passphrase=thephrase
----
* Edit _~/.bashrc_ and add _-Dgpg.passphrase=thephrase_ to _MAVEN_OPTS_
* Edit your active Maven profile to include a _"gpg.passphrase"_ property with readle value:
+
[source,xml]
----
<profiles>
  <profile>
    <properties>
      <gpg.passphrase>roorules</gpg.passphrase>
----
* Use an encrypted  _"gpg.passphrase"_:
.. Create a master password
+
[source,bash]
----
$ ./mvnw --encrypt-master-password <password>
----
.. Store this password in the _~/.m2/settings-security.xml_. It should look like:
+
[source,xml]
----
<settingsSecurity>
  <master>{jSMOWnoPFgsHVpMvz5VrIt5kRbzGpI8u+9EF1iFQyJQ=}</master>
</settingsSecurity>
----
.. Encrypt gpg passphrase:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ ./mvnw --encrypt-password <passphrase>
----
.. Store it into your _settings.xml_ file in the server section. This will look like:
+
[source,xml]
----
<settings>
...
  <servers>
  ...
    <server>
      <id>gpg.passphrase</id>
      <passphrase>{COQLCE6DU6GtcS5P=}</passphrase>
    </server>
  ...
  </servers>
...
</settings>
----

Of course the most secure options are to type the password every time and to encrypt the password. However, the most comfortable is to encrypt the password especially *if you're doing a lot of builds*.

NOTE: _If you're new to GPG: don't lose your private key! Backup the secring.gpg file, as you'll need it to ever revoke your key or sign a replacement key (the public key servers offer no way to revoke a key unless you can sign the revocation request)._

== Create a Fork

For contributors that want to write code, we encourage contributions through pull requests from https://help.github.com/forking/[forks of this repository].

NOTE: Developers with appropriate permissions may work through branches.

The commit messages must follow https://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html[these conventions], if you are fixing an existing issue add *"ROO-XXXX:"* (without the quotation marks) at the begining of the commit message (where XXXX is the issue number).

== Code Conventions

* Use the Spring Roo project https://github.com/google/styleguide[code format conventions].

** The developers and contributors that uses STS or Eclipse should import the formatter settings via menu:Window[Properties > Java > Code Style > Formatter > Import], using the link:devel-resources/eclipse-java-code-style-formatter.xml[eclipse-java-code-style-formatter.xml] file from the _devel-resources_ folder.

** For the developers that build the project with the `./mvnw` command, the https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.googlecode.maven-java-formatter-plugin/maven-java-formatter-plugin[Maven Java Formatter plugin] has been included in the link:pom.xml[pom.xml] file to format the Java source files automatically using the link:devel-resources/eclipse-java-code-style-formatter.xml[eclipse-java-code-style-formatter.xml] file from the _devel-resources_ folder.

* Make sure all new _.java_ files to have the Javadoc class comment with the `@author` tag identifying you as well as a paragraph on what the class is for.

* Add the ASF license header comment to all new _.java_ files (copy from existing files in the project).

* Add the Javadoc comments to all new class methods as well as class attributes.

== Working with the Code

Spring Roo itself is a standard https://maven.apache.org/[Maven] project and therefore any _standard IDE_ can be used for development. *No extra plugins are needed*.

The team use https://www.eclipse.org/[Eclipse] or https://spring.io/tools[STS] to develop Roo, just import the project branch as standard Maven project via menu:File[Import > Maven > Existing Maven Projects] into the Workspace.

In theory you could use the https://www.eclipse.org/m2e/[m2eclipse plugin]. The Roo team just tends to use the shell command `./mvnw` instead.

=== Building from Source

The project can be built from the root directory using the standard maven command:

[source,bash]
----
$ ./mvnw clean install
----

NOTE: You may need to increase the amount of memory available to Maven by setting a `MAVEN_OPTS` environment variable with the value `-Xmx1024m -XX:MaxPermSize=512m`

If you are rebuilding often, you might also want to skip the housekeeping until you are ready to submit a pull request:

[source,bash]
----
$ ./mvnw clean install -DskipTests -Dmaven.gpg.skip=true -Dgpg.skip=true -Dmaven.javadoc.skip=true -Dformatter.skip=true -Dmaven.source.skip=true -Dmaven.formatter.skip=true -DskipRelease
----

==== Test the build

Roo ships with a command line tool called *roo-dev*. It copies all relevant JARs from a success build into _$ROO_HOME/runtime/bootstrap/target/osgi/_. This directory represents a Roo build snapshot instance.

To test your contribution just try Roo, go to the application project directory and run _roo-dev_:

[source,bash]
----
$ cd $PROJECT_HOME
$ $ROO_HOME/runtime/bootstrap/roo-dev
----
