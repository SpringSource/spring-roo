Getting started with Spring Roo development

Spring Roo is an easy-to-use development tool for quickly building Spring-powered applications.

Our primary goals are:

* Build Spring-powered applications in a best-practice manner within minutes.
+
To develop Spring projects requires incredibly long cycle times yet, yes Spring Boot provide a radically faster and widely accessible getting started experience plus non-functional features for all Spring development and due that Spring Roo generates Spring Boot applications, but even so for midsize applications you need functional features, patterns and best-practices that Spring Roo provides you automatically.
* Incremental approach to add technologies as needed to your project.
+
This means when you first start a new project Roo will only assume you want to build a simple Spring Boot application. As such it will have next to no dependencies. Only when you ask to add a persistence provider will JPA be installed, and only when you add a field using JavaBean Validation annotations will that library be installed. The same holds true for Spring Security, Spring Data and the other technologies Roo supports.
* Use Roo over the full lifespan of a project.
+
This is particularly important given the long-term maintenance costs of a project far outweigh the initial development costs. While you can use Roo just for an initial jump-start if you so wish, your return on investment is exponential as you continue using it throughout a project lifespan.

See the link:CONTRIBUTING.adoc[contributor guidelines] for details.

[[build-the-source]]
== Building from Source

The Spring Roo project uses a http://maven.apache.org/[Maven]-based build system. 

Spring Roo can be easily built with the https://github.com/takari/maven-wrapper[maven wrapper] from the root of the source tree and serves as a cross-platform, self-contained bootstrap mechanism for the build:

[source,bash]
----
$ ./mvnw clean install
----

See the link:CONTRIBUTING.adoc[contributor guidelines] for details.

[[acknowledgments]]
== Acknowledgments

The Spring Roo project uses and depends on a lot of Spring related projects, as well as other ones. We would like to thank all those projects and the people working on them, not only for the effort made to provide such excellent libraries and utilities, but also for the guidance and examples given on how to manage an open source Java project.

Also, this README.adoc file has been written based on the ones included in several Spring projects like https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot[Spring Boot project] and https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-data-jpa[Spring Data JPA].
