= Releasing Spring Roo
:experimental:
:page-layout: base
:toc-placement: manual
:author: DISID Corporation S.L.
:email: <springroo@disid.com>

Spring Roo is released on a regular basis by the *Roo project team*. To perform releases and make the associated announcements you require *appropriate permissions to many systems* (as listed below). As such these notes are intended to assist developers with such permissions complete releases.

== Code of Conduct

This project adheres to the Contributor Covenant link:CODE_OF_CONDUCT.adoc[code of conduct]. By participating, you  are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to spring-code-of-conduct@pivotal.io.

== Before Releasing

* *GPG setup* (probably already setup if you followed notes above)
* *Git push privileges* (if you can commit, you have this)
* *s3cmd setup* (so "s3cmd ls" lists spring-roo-repository.springsource.org)
* *~/.m2/settings.xml* for spring-roo-repository-release and spring-roo-repository-snapshot IDs with S3 username/password
* @SpringRoo *twitter account credentials*
* spring.io/projects/spring-roo *editor privileges*. Note you need editor
  privileges for source pages at 
  https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-roo/tree/gh-pages
* JIRA project *administrator privileges*
* Close down your IDE before proceeding

== Release Process

. Complete a thorough testing build and assembly ZIP:
+
[source, shell]
----
cd $ROO_HOME
git pull --rebase
cd $ROO_HOME/runtime/deployment-support
./roo-deploy-dist.sh -c next -n 4.5.6.RELEASE (use -v for logging)
cd $ROO_HOME
mvn clean install
cd $ROO_HOME/runtime/deployment-support
./roo-deploy-dist.sh -c assembly -tv (use -t for extra tests)
----

. Verify the assembly ZIP ($ROO_HOME/target/roo-deploy/dist/*.zip) looks good:

- Assembly ZIP unzips and is of a sensible size
- Assembly ZIP runs correctly when installed on major platforms
- Create Jira Task ticket "Release Spring Roo x.y.z.aaaaaa"
- Run the "reference guide" command in the Roo shell, copy the resulting XML file into $ROO_HOME/deployment-support/src/site/docbook/reference, git commit and then git push (so the appendix is updated)

. Tag the release (update the key ID, Jira ID and tag ID):
+
[source, shell]
cd $ROO_HOME
git tag -a -m "ROO-XXXX: Release Spring Roo 4.5.6.RELEASE" 4.5.6.RELEASE

. Build JARs:
+
[source, shell]
 cd $ROO_HOME
 mvn clean package

. Build the reference guide and deploy to the static staging server. You must be connected to the VPN for deployment to work. Note that https://projects.spring.io/spring-roo/ is updated bi-hourly from staging:
+
[source, shell]
cd $ROO_HOME/deployment-support
mvn clean site site:deploy

. Create the final assembly ZIP (must happen *after* site built). We run full tests here, even ensuring all the Maven artifacts used by user projects are available. This takes a lot of time, but it is very helpful for our users:
+
[source, shell]
cd $ROO_HOME/deployment-support
./roo-deploy-dist.sh -c assembly -Tv (-T means Maven tests with empty repo)

. Repeat the verification tests on the assembly ZIP (see above). See note below if coordinating a release with the STS team.
+
Typically after this step you'll *send the tested assembly ZIP to the STS team for a concurrent release*. Allow time for them to test the ZIP before starting step 8. This allows verification of STS embeddeding. Keep your ROO_HOME intact during this time, as you need the **/target and /.git directories for steps 8 and 9 to be completed.

. If the verifications pass, push the Git tag up to the server:
+
[source, shell]
cd $ROO_HOME
git push --tags

. Deploy the JARs to Maven Central
+
[source, shell]
cd $ROO_HOME
mvn clean deploy

. Deploy assembly ZIP (binaries) to the production download servers (it takes up to an hour for these to be made fully downloadable):
+
[source, shell]
cd $ROO_HOME/deployment-support
./roo-deploy-dist.sh -c deploy (use -dv for a dry-run and verbose logging)

. Increment the version number to the next BUILD-SNAPSHOT number:
+
[source, shell]
cd $ROO_HOME/deployment-support
./roo-deploy-dist.sh -c next -n 4.5.6.BUILD-SNAPSHOT (use -v for logging)
cd $ROO_HOME
mvn clean install eclipse:clean eclipse:eclipse
cd ~/new-project-directory; roo-dev script clinic.roo; mvn test
cd $ROO_HOME
git diff
git commit -a -m "ROO-XXXX: Update to next version"
git push

. Update the `Apache Felix` libraries and the `Spring Roo` libraries included in the Spring Roo STS Plugin. These libraries are located in https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-ide/tree/master/plugins/org.springframework.ide.eclipse.roo.core/lib. After include the new libraries, send a pull-request with the applied changes. 

NOTE: _If any problems are detected before step 8, *simply fix*, push and start from step 1 again. You have not deployed anything substantial (ie only the reference guide) until step 8, so some corrections and re-tagging can be performed without any difficulty. The critical requirement is to defer step 8 (and beyond) until you're sure everything is fine_

=== Pre-notification testing

* Visit https://projects.spring.io/spring-roo/, click "Download!"
* Ensure it unzips OK and the sha1sum matches the downloaded .sha
* `rm -rf ~/.m2/repository/org/springframework/roo`
* Use "roo script clinic.roo" to build a new Roo project
* Use "mvn clean test" to verify Roo's annotation JAR downloads

=== Notifications and administration

Once the release is completed (ie all steps above) you'll typically:

* Mark the version as "released" in JIRA (_Admin > JIRA Admin_...)
* Publish a https://spring.io/blog/ entry explaining what's new
* Update https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_Roo with the version
* Edit project page https://projects.spring.io/spring-roo/
* Tweet from @SpringRoo (NB: ensure #SpringRoo is in the message)
* Tweet from your personal account
* Email dev list
* Resolve the "release ticket" in JIRA
